#  AtSea Demo Application

## Current build and run 

> If you have Docker 17.05+ with multistage builds:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

> Otherwise:

```bash
mkdir -p app/react-app/node_modules
npm install --prefix app/react-app
npm run build --prefix app/react-app
rm -r app/static; mv app/react-app/build app/static
docker swarm init # needed if not presently in swarm mode
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/atsea -w /atsea maven:alpine mvn package -DskipTests
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

(Unfortunately the above will most likely not work on Linux due to root bind
mount, you will need to get craftier with user remapping if executing there)

Browse to the app at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

The REST API base URL is `http://localhost:8080/api/`.

## The demo application is a store application with the following features:

* user account creation and sign-in 
* a products page listing all available products
* a detail page for an individual products
* a shopping cart to add products
* an order page that displays the products in the cart and a total

A page for each feature will be needed in the client.

## The application architecture includes:

* microservices REST backend written in Java and spring-boot to handle the store functions
* PostgreSQL database for product inventory, customer data, and order data
* Nginx proxies for serving static data and handling HTTPS request
* store front client written in Angular

## Front end is being written in React and currently looks like this:

Local development:
From the `react-app` directory (within `app`), run `npm install` then `npm run start`.
  Navigate to localhost:3000. Any changes within `react-app` will be updated in real-time.

Update static files:
```bash
  cd react-app
  npm run build
  cd ../
  rm -r static; mv react-app/build static
```
Finally, re-run `docker-compose up`
Navigate to localhost:8080 to see your changes.

* The command `npm run build` builds the react-app for production in the build folder.
  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. 
* The command  `mv react-app/build static` moves the build folder to the static folder.
* The multistage build can be seen in `app/Dockerfile.app`
  This includes building and updating the static files.
```bash
    FROM node:latest
    COPY . /usr/src/atsea
    WORKDIR /usr/src/atsea/app/react-app
    RUN npm install
    RUN npm run build
```


## The operational architecture features:

### Swarm features supported and highlighted:
* Secrets
* Routing mesh
* Overlay networks
* Dynamic storage (infinit.io)
* Can run as a single stateless container
* Can be deployed as multi-container stateful app through compose v3 (docker stack deploy)
* Can be deployed on Docker 4 Mac for development demo
* Message queue
* Optimize for startup time

### UCP features supported and highlighted:
* L7 loadbalancing (HRM)
* HRM sticky sessions
* HRM HTTPS (SNI)

### Other ideas:
* Jmeter load generation
* NFS store for static content

## Configuration

### Static content
Make a directory for static content called 'static' in the same directory as the appication (atsea-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar)

```
Application
|- AtSea-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
|- static/
   |- client files
   |- images
   |_ ...

```

the URL for the content is http://localhost:8080/*
